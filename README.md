## About project

- This is a simple SQL library that I made as part of my learning new things in Unity and strict OOP Research
- In fact, this is just a wrapper over another library - [Npgsql](https://www.npgsql.org/)
- The library contains classes for using basic SQL commands(CRUD), but allows you to execute any command in any mode (Reader, NonQuery, Scalar and async versions of them)

### Specifics
- Project using **OOP** and **SOLID**
- Procedural SQL algorithms deisgned to be **True OOP**
- Clearest **DI** and **SRP**
- My first library that I published
